      C Language -Overview
    </title>
  </head>
  <body class="ok">

    <p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.</p>
    <p>In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&amp;R standard.</p>
    <p>The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons &minus;</p>
    <ul class="list">
    <li>Easy to learn</li>
    <li>Structured language</li>
    <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
    <li>It can handle low-level activities</li>
    <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Facts about C</h2>
    <ul class="list">
    <li><p>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</p></li>
    <li><p>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</p></li>
    <li><p>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p></li>
    <li><p>The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</p></li>
    <li><p>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</p></li>
    <li><p>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</p></li>
    <li><p>Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why use C?</h2>
    <p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be &minus;</p>
    <ul class="list">
    <li>Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Language Compilers</li>
    <li>Assemblers</li>
    <li>Text Editors</li>
    <li>Print Spoolers</li>
    <li>Network Drivers</li>
    <li>Modern Programs</li>
    <li>Databases</li>
    <li>Language Interpreters</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>C Programs</h2>
    <p>A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension <b>".c"</b>; for example, <i>hello.c</i>. You can use <b>"vi"</b>, <b>"vim"</b> or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.</p>
    <p>This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.</p>
