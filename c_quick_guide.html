  <p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.</p>
  <p>In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&amp;R standard.</p>
  <p>The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li>Easy to learn</li>
  <li>Structured language</li>
  <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
  <li>It can handle low-level activities</li>
  <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Facts about C</h2>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</p></li>
  <li><p>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</p></li>
  <li><p>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p></li>
  <li><p>The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</p></li>
  <li><p>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</p></li>
  <li><p>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</p></li>
  <li><p>Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why use C?</h2>
  <p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li>Operating Systems</li>
  <li>Language Compilers</li>
  <li>Assemblers</li>
  <li>Text Editors</li>
  <li>Print Spoolers</li>
  <li>Network Drivers</li>
  <li>Modern Programs</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
  <li>Language Interpreters</li>
  <li>Utilities</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>C Programs</h2>
  <p>A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension <b>".c"</b>; for example, <i>hello.c</i>. You can use <b>"vi"</b>, <b>"vim"</b> or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.</p>
  <p>This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.</p>
  <h1>C - Environment Setup</h1>
  <h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>
  <p>If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.</p>
  <h2>Text Editor</h2>
  <p>This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.</p>
  <p>The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.</p>
  <p>The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension "<b>.c</b>".</p>
  <p>Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.</p>
  <h2>The C Compiler</h2>
  <p>The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.</p>
  <p>The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.</p>
  <p>The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.</p>
  <h2>Installation on UNIX/Linux</h2>
  <p>If you are using <b>Linux or UNIX</b>, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $ gcc -v
  </pre>
  <p>If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Using built-in specs.
  Target: i386-redhat-linux
  Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr .......
  Thread model: posix
  gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-46)
  </pre>
  <p>If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/install/</a></p>
  <p>This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.</p>
  <h2>Installation on Mac OS</h2>
  <p>If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.</p>
  <p>Xcode is currently available at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/</a>.</p>
  <h2>Installation on Windows</h2>
  <p>To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage, <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> www.mingw.org</a>, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-&lt;version&gt;.exe.</p>
  <p>While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.</p>
  <p>Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your <b>PATH</b> environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.</p>
  <p>After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.</p>
  <h1>C - Program Structure</h1>
  <p>Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.</p>
  <h2>Hello World Example</h2>
  <p>A C program basically consists of the following parts &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li>Preprocessor Commands</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
  <li>Variables</li>
  <li>Statements &amp; Expressions</li>
  <li>Comments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World" &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/3Ty4QP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main() {
     /* my first program in C */
     printf("Hello, World! \n");

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>The first line of the program <i>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</i> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.</p></li>
  <li><p>The next line <i>int main()</i> is the main function where the program execution begins.</p></li>
  <li><p>The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.</p></li>
  <li><p>The next line <i>printf(...)</i> is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.</p></li>
  <li><p>The next line <b>return 0;</b> terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Compile and Execute C Program</h2>
  <p>Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.</p></li>
  <li><p>Save the file as <i>hello.c</i></p></li>
  <li><p>Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.</p></li>
  <li><p>Type <i>gcc hello.c</i> and press enter to compile your code.</p></li>
  <li><p>If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate <i>a.out</i> executable file.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now, type <i>a.out</i> to execute your program.</p></li>
  <li><p>You will see the output <i>"Hello World"</i> printed on the screen.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $ gcc hello.c
  $ ./a.out
  Hello, World!
  </pre>
  <p>Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.</p>
  <h1>C - Basic Syntax</h1>
  <p>You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.</p>
  <h2>Tokens in C</h2>
  <p>A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  printf("Hello, World! \n");
  </pre>
  <p>The individual tokens are &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  printf
  (
     "Hello, World! \n"
  )
  ;
  </pre>
  <h2>Semicolons</h2>
  <p>In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.</p>
  <p>Given below are two different statements &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  printf("Hello, World! \n");
  return 0;
  </pre>
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  /* my first program in C */
  </pre>
  <p>You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.</p>
  <h2>Identifiers</h2>
  <p>A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
  <p>C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a <b>case-sensitive</b> programming language. Thus, <i>Manpower</i> and <i>manpower</i> are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  mohd       zara    abc   move_name  a_123
  myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal
  </pre>
  <h2>Keywords</h2>
  <p>The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.</p>
  <table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
  <td style="width:25%">auto</td>
  <td style="width:25%">else</td>
  <td style="width:25%">long</td>
  <td style="width:25%">switch</td>

  <td>_Packed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>double</td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <h2>Whitespace in C</h2>
  <p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.</p>
  <p>Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  int age;
  </pre>
  <p>there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  fruit = apples + oranges;   // get the total fruit
  </pre>
  <p>no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.</p>
  <h1>C - Data Types</h1>
  <p>Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.</p>
  <p>The types in C can be classified as follows &minus;</p>
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
  <th style="text-align:center;">Sr.No.</th>
  <th style="text-align:center;">Types &amp; Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">1</td>
  <td><p><b>Basic Types</b></p>
  <p>They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.</p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">2</td>
  <td><p><b>Enumerated types</b></p>
  <p>They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.</p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">3</td>
  <td><p><b>The type void</b></p>
  <p>The type specifier <i>void</i> indicates that no value is available.</p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">4</td>
  <td><p><b>Derived types</b></p>
  <p>They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.</p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.</p>
  <h2>Integer Types</h2>
  <p>The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges &minus;</p>

  <h1>C - Variables</h1>
  <p>A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>
  <p>The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types &minus;</p>

  </table>
  <p>C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.</p>
  <h2>Variable Definition in C</h2>
  <p>A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  type variable_list;
  </pre>
  <p>Here, <b>type</b> must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and <b>variable_list</b> may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int    i, j, k;
  char   c, ch;
  float  f, salary;
  double d;
  </pre>
  <p>The line <b>int i, j, k;</b> declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.</p>
  <p>Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  type variable_name = value;
  </pre>
  <p>Some examples are &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  extern int d = 3, f = 5;    // declaration of d and f.
  int d = 3, f = 5;           // definition and initializing d and f.
  byte z = 22;                // definition and initializes z.
  char x = 'x';               // the variable x has the value 'x'.
  </pre>
  <p>For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.</p>
  <h2>Variable Declaration in C</h2>
  <p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.</p>
  <p>A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword <b>extern</b> to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/73XWiV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  // Variable declaration:
  extern int a, b;
  extern int c;
  extern float f;

  int main () {

     /* variable definition: */
     int a, b;
     int c;
     float f;

     /* actual initialization */
     a = 10;
     b = 20;

     c = a + b;
     printf("value of c : %d \n", c);

     f = 70.0/3.0;
     printf("value of f : %f \n", f);

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  value of c : 30
  value of f : 23.333334
  </pre>
  <p>The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  // function declaration
  int func();

  int main() {

     // function call
     int i = func();
  }

  // function definition
  int func() {
     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <h2>Lvalues and Rvalues in C</h2>
  <p>There are two kinds of expressions in C &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p><b>lvalue</b> &minus; Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>rvalue</b> &minus; The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int g = 20; // valid statement

  10 = 20; // invalid statement; would generate compile-time error
  </pre>
  <h1>C - Constants and Literals</h1>
  <p>Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called <b>literals</b>.</p>
  <p>Constants can be of any of the basic data types like <i>an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal</i>. There are enumeration constants as well.</p>
  <p>Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.</p>
  <h2>Integer Literals</h2>
  <p>An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.</p>
  <p>An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples of integer literals &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  212         /* Legal */
  215u        /* Legal */
  0xFeeL      /* Legal */
  078         /* Illegal: 8 is not an octal digit */
  032UU       /* Illegal: cannot repeat a suffix */
  </pre>
  <p>Following are other examples of various types of integer literals &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  85         /* decimal */
  0213       /* octal */
  0x4b       /* hexadecimal */
  30         /* int */
  30u        /* unsigned int */
  30l        /* long */
  30ul       /* unsigned long */
  </pre>
  <h2>Floating-point Literals</h2>
  <p>A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.</p>
  <p>While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples of floating-point literals &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  3.14159       /* Legal */
  314159E-5L    /* Legal */
  510E          /* Illegal: incomplete exponent */
  210f          /* Illegal: no decimal or exponent */
  .e55          /* Illegal: missing integer or fraction */
  </pre>
  <h2>Character Constants</h2>
  <p>Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of <b>char</b> type.</p>
  <p>A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').</p>
  <p>There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).</p>

  </pre>
  <h2>String Literals</h2>
  <p>String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.</p>
  <p>You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  "hello, dear"

  "hello, \

  dear"

  "hello, " "d" "ear"

  <h2>Defining Constants</h2>
  <p>There are two simple ways in C to define constants &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>Using <b>#define</b> preprocessor.</p></li>
  <li><p>Using <b>const</b> keyword.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The #define Preprocessor</h2>
  <p>Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  #define identifier value
  </pre>
  <p>The following example explains it in detail &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/p8YVAu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  #define LENGTH 10
  #define WIDTH  5
  #define NEWLINE '\n'

  int main() {
     int area;

     area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
     printf("value of area : %d", area);
     printf("%c", NEWLINE);

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  value of area : 50
  </pre>
  <h2>The const Keyword</h2>
  <p>You can use <b>const</b> prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  const type variable = value;
  </pre>
  <p>The following example explains it in detail &minus;</p>

     area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
     printf("value of area : %d", area);
     printf("%c", NEWLINE);

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  value of area : 50
  </pre>
  <p>Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.</p>
  <h1>C - Storage Classes</h1>
  <p>A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li>auto</li>
  <li>register</li>
  <li>static</li>
  <li>extern</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The auto Storage Class</h2>
  <p>The <b>auto</b> storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  {
     int mount;
     auto int month;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.</p>
  <h2>The register Storage Class</h2>
  <p>The <b>register</b> storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&amp;' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  {
     register int  miles;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.</p>
  <h2>The static Storage Class</h2>
  <p>The <b>static</b> storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.</p>
  <p>The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.</p>
  <p>In C programming, when <b>static</b> is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/kZFxpW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  /* function declaration */
  void func(void);

  static int count = 5; /* global variable */

  main() {

     while(count--) {
        func();
     }

     return 0;
  }

  /* function definition */
  void func( void ) {

     static int i = 5; /* local static variable */
     i++;

     printf("i is %d and count is %d\n", i, count);
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  i is 6 and count is 4
  i is 7 and count is 3
  i is 8 and count is 2
  i is 9 and count is 1
  i is 10 and count is 0
  </pre>
  <h2>The extern Storage Class</h2>
  <p>The <b>extern</b> storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.</p>
  <p>When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then <i>extern</i> will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, <i>extern</i> is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.</p>
  <p>The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.</p>
  <p><b>First File: main.c</b></p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int count ;
  extern void write_extern();

  main() {
     count = 5;
     write_extern();
  }
  </pre>
  <p><b>Second File: support.c</b></p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  extern int count;

  void write_extern(void) {
     printf("count is %d\n", count);
  }
  </pre>
  <p>Here, <i>extern</i> is being used to declare <i>count</i> in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $gcc main.c support.c
  </pre>
  <p>It will produce the executable program <b>a.out</b>. When this program is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  count is 5
  </pre>
  <h1>C - Operators</h1>
  <p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators &minus;</p>

  <h2>Operators Precedence in C</h2>
  <p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.</p>
  <p>For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.</p>
  <p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>

  <h1>C - Loops</h1>
  <p>You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>
  <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
  <p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

  <h2>The Infinite Loop</h2>
  <p>A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The <b>for</b> loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main () {

     for( ; ; ) {
        printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
     }

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE</b> &minus; You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.</p>
  <h1>C - Functions</h1>
  <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is <b>main()</b>, and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.</p>
  <p>You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.</p>
  <p>A function <b>declaration</b> tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function <b>definition</b> provides the actual body of the function.</p>
  <p>The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, <b>strcat()</b> to concatenate two strings, <b>memcpy()</b> to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.</p>
  <p>A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.</p>
  <h2>Defining a Function</h2>
  <p>The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  return_type function_name( parameter list ) {
     body of the function
  }
  </pre>
  <p>A function definition in C programming consists of a <i>function header</i> and a <i>function body</i>. Here are all the parts of a function &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p><b>Return Type</b> &minus; A function may return a value. The <b>return_type</b> is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword <b>void</b>.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Function Name</b> &minus; This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Function Body</b> &minus; The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Given below is the source code for a function called <b>max()</b>. This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  /* function returning the max between two numbers */
  int max(int num1, int num2) {

     /* local variable declaration */
     int result;

     if (num1 &gt; num2)
        result = num1;
     else
        result = num2;

     return result;
  }
  </pre>
  <h2>Function Declarations</h2>
  <p>A function <b>declaration</b> tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.</p>
  <p>A function declaration has the following parts &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  return_type function_name( parameter list );
  </pre>
  <p>For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int max(int num1, int num2);
  </pre>
  <p>Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int max(int, int);
  </pre>
  <p>Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.</p>
  <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
  <p>While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.</p>
  <p>When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.</p>
  <p>To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/T4MSFr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  /* function declaration */
  int max(int num1, int num2);

  int main () {

     /* local variable definition */
     int a = 100;
     int b = 200;
     int ret;

     /* calling a function to get max value */
     ret = max(a, b);

     printf( "Max value is : %d\n", ret );

     return 0;
  }

  /* function returning the max between two numbers */
  int max(int num1, int num2) {

     /* local variable declaration */
     int result;

     if (num1 &gt; num2)
        result = num1;
     else
        result = num2;

     return result;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Max value is : 200
  </pre>
  <h2>Function Arguments</h2>
  <p>If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the <b>formal parameters</b> of the function.</p>
  <p>Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.</p>
  <p>While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function &minus;</p>

  <h1>C - Scope Rules</h1>
  <p>A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>Inside a function or a block which is called <b>local</b> variables.</p></li>
  <li><p>Outside of all functions which is called <b>global</b> variables.</p></li>
  <li><p>In the definition of function parameters which are called <b>formal</b> parameters.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let us understand what are <b>local</b> and <b>global</b> variables, and <b>formal</b> parameters.</p>
  <h2>Local Variables</h2>
  <p>Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.</p>

  <h2>Global Variables</h2>
  <p>Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.</p>
  <p>A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.</p>

  <h2>Initializing Local and Global Variables</h2>
  <p>When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows &minus;</p>

  <p>It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.</p>
  <h1>C - Arrays</h1>
  <p>Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.</p>
  <p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.</p>
  <p>All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.</p>
  <img src="/cprogramming/images/arrays.jpg" alt="Arrays in C" />
  <h2>Declaring Arrays</h2>
  <p>To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  type arrayName [ arraySize ];
  </pre>
  <p>This is called a <i>single-dimensional</i> array. The <b>arraySize</b> must be an integer constant greater than zero and <b>type</b> can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called <b>balance</b> of type double, use this statement &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  double balance[10];
  </pre>
  <p>Here <i>balance</i> is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.</p>
  <h2>Initializing Arrays</h2>
  <p>You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
  </pre>
  <p>The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].</p>
  <p>If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
  </pre>
  <p>You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  balance[4] = 50.0;
  </pre>
  <p>The above statement assigns the 5<sup>th</sup> element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above &minus;</p>
  <img src="/cprogramming/images/array_presentation.jpg" alt="Array Presentation" />
  <h2>Accessing Array Elements</h2>
  <p>An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  double salary = balance[9];
  </pre>
  <p>The above statement will take the 10<sup>th</sup> element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays &minus;</p>

  <h1>C - Pointers</h1>
  <p>Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.</p>
  <p>As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&amp;) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">

  int main () {

     int  var1;
     char var2[10];

     printf("Address of var1 variable: %x\n", &amp;var1  );
     printf("Address of var2 variable: %x\n", &amp;var2  );

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Address of var1 variable: bff5a400
  Address of var2 variable: bff5a3f6
  </pre>
  <h2>What are Pointers?</h2>
  <p>A <b>pointer</b> is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  type *var-name;
  </pre>
  <p>Here, <b>type</b> is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and <b>var-name</b> is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
  double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
  float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
  char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
  </pre>
  <p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>
  <h2>How to Use Pointers?</h2>
  <p>There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. <b>(a)</b> We define a pointer variable, <b>(b)</b> assign the address of a variable to a pointer and <b>(c)</b> finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator <b>*</b> that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations &minus;</p>

     printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &amp;var  );

     /* address stored in pointer variable */
     printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );

     /* access the value using the pointer */
     printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Address of var variable: bffd8b3c
  Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c
  Value of *ip variable: 20
  </pre>
  <h2>NULL Pointers</h2>
  <p>It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a <b>null</b> pointer.</p>
  <p>The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/xGfUyr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main () {

     int  *ptr = NULL;

     printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  The value of ptr is 0
  </pre>
  <p>In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.</p>
  <p>To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  if(ptr)     /* succeeds if p is not null */
  if(!ptr)    /* succeeds if p is null */

  <h2>Bit Fields</h2>
  <p>Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.</p></li>
  <li><p>Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  struct packed_struct {
     unsigned int f1:1;
     unsigned int f2:1;
     unsigned int f3:1;
     unsigned int f4:1;
     unsigned int type:4;
     unsigned int my_int:9;
  } pack;
  </pre>
  <p>Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.</p>
  <p>C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.</p>
  <h1>C - Unions</h1>
  <p>A <b>union</b> is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.</p>
  <h2>Defining a Union</h2>
  <p>To define a union, you must use the <b>union</b> statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  union [union tag] {
     member definition;
     member definition;
     ...
     member definition;
  } [one or more union variables];
  </pre>
  <p>The <b>union tag</b> is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  union Data {
     int i;
     float f;
     char str[20];
  } data;
  </pre>
  <p>Now, a variable of <b>Data</b> type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.</p>
  <p>The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union &minus;</p>

  };

  int main( ) {

     union Data data;

     printf( "Memory size occupied by data : %d\n", sizeof(data));

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Memory size occupied by data : 20
  </pre>
  <h2>Accessing Union Members</h2>
  <p>To access any member of a union, we use the <b>member access operator (.)</b>.

The following example shows how to use unions in a program &minus;</p>

  union Data {
     int i;
     float f;
     char str[20];
  };

  int main( ) {

     union Data data;

     data.i = 10;
     data.f = 220.5;
     strcpy( data.str, "C Programming");

     printf( "data.i : %d\n", data.i);
     printf( "data.f : %f\n", data.f);
     printf( "data.str : %s\n", data.str);

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  data.i : 1917853763
  data.f : 4122360580327794860452759994368.000000
  data.str : C Programming
  </pre>
  <p>Here, we can see that the values of <b>i</b> and <b>f</b> members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of <b>str</b> member is getting printed very well.</p>
  <p>Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions &minus;</p>

     strcpy( data.str, "C Programming");
     printf( "data.str : %s\n", data.str);

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  data.i : 10
  data.f : 220.500000
  data.str : C Programming
  </pre>
  <p>Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.</p>
  <h1>C - Bit Fields</h1>
  <p>Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  struct {
     unsigned int widthValidated;
     unsigned int heightValidated;
  } status;
  </pre>
  <p>This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.</p>
  <p>If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  struct {
     unsigned int widthValidated : 1;
     unsigned int heightValidated : 1;
  } status;
  </pre>
  <p>The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.</p>
  <p>If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept &minus;</p>

  <h2>Bit Field Declaration</h2>

  <th>Sr.No.</th>
  <th style="text-align:center;">Element &amp; Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">1</td>
  <td><p><b>type</b></p>
  <p>An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">2</td>
  <td><p><b>member_name</b></p>
  <p>The name of the bit-field.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">3</td>
  <td><p><b>width</b></p>
  <p>The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.</p></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The variables defined with a predefined width are called <b>bit fields</b>. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  struct {
     unsigned int age : 3;
  } Age;
  </pre>
  <p>The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example &minus;</p>

     Age.age = 8;
     printf( "Age.age : %d\n", Age.age );

     return 0;

  <p>C programming treats all the devices as files. So devices such as the display are addressed in the same way as files and the following three files are automatically opened when a program executes to provide access to the keyboard and screen.</p>
  <table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
  <th style="width:30%;text-align:center;">Standard File</th>
  <th style="text-align:center;">File Pointer</th>
  <th style="text-align:center;">Device</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Standard input</td>
  <td>stdin</td>
  <td>Keyboard</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Standard output</td>
  <td>stdout</td>
  <td>Screen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Standard error</td>
  <td>stderr</td>
  <td>Your screen</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The file pointers are the means to access the file for reading and writing purpose. This section explains how to read values from the screen and how to print the result on the screen.</p>
  <h2>The getchar() and putchar() Functions</h2>
  <p>The <b>int getchar(void)</b> function reads the next available character from the screen and returns it as an integer. This function reads only single character at a time. You can use this method in the loop in case you want to read more than one character from the screen.</p>
  <p>The <b>int putchar(int c)</b> function puts the passed character on the screen and returns the same character. This function puts only single character at a time. You can use this method in the loop in case you want to display more than one character on the screen. Check the following example &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  int main( ) {

     int c;

     printf( "Enter a value :");
     c = getchar( );

     printf( "\nYou entered: ");
     putchar( c );

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it waits for you to input some text. When you enter a text and press enter, then the program proceeds and reads only a single character and displays it as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $./a.out
  <b>Enter a value :</b> this is test
  <b>You entered:</b> t
  </pre>
  <h2>The gets() and puts() Functions</h2>
  <p>The <b>char *gets(char *s)</b> function reads a line from <b>stdin</b> into the buffer pointed to by <b>s</b> until either a terminating newline or EOF (End of File).</p>
  <p>The <b>int puts(const char *s)</b> function writes the string 's' and 'a' trailing newline to <b>stdout</b>.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> Though it has been deprecated to use gets() function, Instead of using gets, you want to use <a href="/c_standard_library/c_function_fgets.htm" title="fgets();">fgets()</a>.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  int main( ) {

     char str[100];

     printf( "Enter a value :");
     gets( str );

     printf( "\nYou entered: ");
     puts( str );

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it waits for you to input some text. When you enter a text and press enter, then the program proceeds and reads the complete line till end, and displays it as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $./a.out
  <b>Enter a value :</b> this is test
  <b>You entered:</b> this is test
  </pre>
  <h2>The scanf() and printf() Functions</h2>
  <p>The <b>int scanf(const char *format, ...)</b>  function reads the input from the standard input stream <b>stdin</b> and scans that input according to the <b>format</b> provided.</p>
  <p>The <b>int printf(const char *format, ...)</b> function writes the output to the standard output stream <b>stdout</b> and produces the output according to the format provided.</p>
  <p>The <b>format</b> can be a simple constant string, but you can specify %s, %d, %c, %f, etc., to print or read strings, integer, character or float respectively. There are many other formatting options available which can be used based on requirements. Let us now proceed with a simple example to understand the concepts better &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  int main( ) {

     char str[100];
     int i;

     printf( "Enter a value :");
     scanf("%s %d", str, &amp;i);

     printf( "\nYou entered: %s %d ", str, i);

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it waits for you to input some text. When you enter a text and press enter, then program proceeds and reads the input and displays it as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $./a.out
  <b>Enter a value :</b> seven 7
  <b>You entered:</b> seven 7
  </pre>
  <p>Here, it should be noted that scanf() expects input in the same format as you provided %s and %d, which means you have to provide valid inputs like "string integer". If you provide "string string" or "integer integer", then it will be assumed as wrong input. Secondly, while reading a string, scanf() stops reading as soon as it encounters a space, so "this is test" are three strings for scanf().</p>
  <h1>C - File I/O</h1>
  <p>The last chapter explained the standard input and output devices handled by C programming language. This chapter cover how C programmers can create, open, close text or binary files for their data storage.</p>
  <p>A file represents a sequence of bytes, regardless of it being a text file or a binary file. C programming language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on your storage devices. This chapter will take you through the important calls for file management.</p>
  <h2>Opening Files</h2>
  <p>You can use the <b>fopen( )</b> function to create a new file or to open an existing file. This call will initialize an object of the type <b>FILE</b>, which contains all the information necessary to control the stream. The prototype of this function call is as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );
  </pre>
  <p>Here, <b>filename</b> is a string literal, which you will use to name your file, and access <b>mode</b> can have one of the following values &minus;</p>
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
  <th style="text-align:center;">Sr.No.</th>
  <th style="text-align:center;">Mode &amp; Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">1</td>
  <td><p><b>r</b></p>
  <p>Opens an existing text file for reading purpose.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">2</td>
  <td><p><b>w</b></p>
  <p>Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start writing content from the beginning of the file.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">3</td>
  <td><p><b>a</b></p>
  <p>Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start appending content in the existing file content.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">4</td>
  <td><p><b>r+</b></p>
  <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">5</td>
  <td><p><b>w+</b></p>
  <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="ts">6</td>
  <td><p><b>a+</b></p>
  <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if it does not exist. The reading will start from the beginning but writing can only be appended.</p></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>If you are going to handle binary files, then you will use following access modes instead of the above mentioned ones &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  "rb", "wb", "ab", "rb+", "r+b", "wb+", "w+b", "ab+", "a+b"
  </pre>
  <h2>Closing a File</h2>
  <p>To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this function is &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int fclose( FILE *fp );
  </pre>
  <p>The <b>fclose(-)</b> function returns zero on success, or <b>EOF</b> if there is an error in closing the file. This function actually flushes any data still pending in the buffer to the file, closes the file, and releases any memory used for the file. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file <b>stdio.h</b>.</p>
  <p>There are various functions provided by C standard library to read and write a file, character by character, or in the form of a fixed length string.</p>
  <h2>Writing a File</h2>
  <p>Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a stream &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int fputc( int c, FILE *fp );
  </pre>
  <p>The function <b>fputc()</b> writes the character value of the argument c to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns the written character written on success otherwise <b>EOF</b> if there is an error. You can use the following functions to write a null-terminated string to a stream &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int fputs( const char *s, FILE *fp );
  </pre>
  <p>The function <b>fputs()</b> writes the string <b>s</b> to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns a non-negative value on success, otherwise <b>EOF</b> is returned in case of any error. You can use <b>int fprintf(FILE *fp,const char *format, ...)</b> function as well to write a string into a file. Try the following example.</p>
  <p>Make sure you have <b>/tmp</b> directory available. If it is not, then before proceeding, you must create this directory on your machine.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  main() {
     FILE *fp;

     fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
     fprintf(fp, "This is testing for fprintf...\n");
     fputs("This is testing for fputs...\n", fp);
     fclose(fp);
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it creates a new file <b>test.txt</b> in /tmp directory and writes two lines using two different functions. Let us read this file in the next section.</p>
  <h2>Reading a File</h2>
  <p>Given below is the simplest function to read a single character from a file &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  int fgetc( FILE * fp );
  </pre>
  <p>The <b>fgetc()</b> function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. The return value is the character read, or in case of any error, it returns <b>EOF</b>. The following function allows to read a string from a stream &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  char *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );
  </pre>
  <p>The functions <b>fgets()</b> reads up to n-1 characters from the input stream referenced by fp. It copies the read string into the buffer <b>buf</b>, appending a <b>null</b> character to terminate the string.</p>
  <p>If this function encounters a newline character '\n' or the end of the file EOF before they have read the maximum number of characters, then it returns only the characters read up to that point including the new line character. You can also use <b>int fscanf(FILE *fp, const char *format, ...)</b> function to read strings from a file, but it stops reading after encountering the first space character.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  main() {

     FILE *fp;
     char buff[255];

     fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "r");
     fscanf(fp, "%s", buff);
     printf("1 : %s\n", buff );

     fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
     printf("2: %s\n", buff );

     fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
     printf("3: %s\n", buff );
     fclose(fp);

  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it reads the file created in the previous section and produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  1 : This
  2: is testing for fprintf...

  3: This is testing for fputs...
  </pre>
  <p>Let's see a little more in detail about what happened here. First, <b>fscanf()</b> read just <b>This</b> because after that, it encountered a space, second call is for <b>fgets()</b> which reads the remaining line till it encountered end of line. Finally, the last call <b>fgets()</b> reads the second line completely.</p>
  <h2>Binary I/O Functions</h2>
  <p>There are two functions, that can be used for binary input and output &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements, size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);

  size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements, size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);
  </pre>
  <p>Both of these functions should be used to read or write blocks of memories - usually arrays or structures.</p>
  <h1>C - Preprocessors</h1>
  <p>The <b>C Preprocessor</b> is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.</p>
  <p>All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives &minus;</p>

  <h2>Preprocessors Examples</h2>
  <p>Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  #define MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH 20
  </pre>
  <p>This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use <i>#define</i> for constants to increase readability.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include "myheader.h"
  </pre>
  <p>These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from <b>System Libraries</b> and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get <b>myheader.h</b> from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #undef  FILE_SIZE
  #define FILE_SIZE 42
  </pre>
  <p>It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #ifndef MESSAGE
     #define MESSAGE "You wish!"
  #endif
  </pre>
  <p>It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #ifdef DEBUG
     /* Your debugging statements here */
  #endif
  </pre>
  <p>It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the <i>-DDEBUG</i> flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.</p>
  <h2>Predefined Macros</h2>
  <p>ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.</p>

  <h2>Preprocessor Operators</h2>
  <p>The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros &minus;</p>
  <h3>The Macro Continuation (\) Operator</h3>
  <p>A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #define  message_for(a, b)  \
     printf(#a " and " #b ": We love you!\n")
  </pre>
  <h3>The Stringize (#) Operator</h3>
  <p>The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/qLYOKm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  #define  message_for(a, b)  \
     printf(#a " and " #b ": We love you!\n")

  int main(void) {
     message_for(Carole, Debra);
     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Carole and Debra: We love you!
  </pre>
  <h3>The Token Pasting (##) Operator</h3>
  <p>The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/2ZlJsc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  #define tokenpaster(n) printf ("token" #n " = %d", token##n)

  int main(void) {
     int token34 = 40;
     tokenpaster(34);
     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  token34 = 40
  </pre>
  <p>It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  printf ("token34 = %d", token34);
  </pre>
  <p>This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both <b>stringize</b> and <b>token-pasting</b>.</p>
  <h3>The Defined() Operator</h3>
  <p>The preprocessor <b>defined</b> operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/Fwp5AX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  #if !defined (MESSAGE)
     #define MESSAGE "You wish!"
  #endif

  int main(void) {
     printf("Here is the message: %s\n", MESSAGE);
     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Here is the message: You wish!
  </pre>
  <h2>Parameterized Macros</h2>
  <p>One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  int square(int x) {
     return x * x;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #define square(x) ((x) * (x))
  </pre>
  <p>Macros with arguments must be defined using the <b>#define</b> directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/gXEa63" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  #define MAX(x,y) ((x) &gt; (y) ? (x) : (y))

  int main(void) {
     printf("Max between 20 and 10 is %d\n", MAX(10, 20));
     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Max between 20 and 10 is 20
  </pre>
  <h1>C - Header Files</h1>
  <p>A header file is a file with extension <b>.h</b> which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.</p>
  <p>You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive <b>#include</b>, like you have seen inclusion of <b>stdio.h</b> header file, which comes along with your compiler.</p>
  <p>Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.</p>
  <p>A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.</p>
  <h2>Include Syntax</h2>
  <p>Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive <b>#include</b>. It has the following two forms &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  #include &lt;file&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  #include "file"
  </pre>
  <p>This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.</p>
  <h2>Include Operation</h2>
  <p>The <b>#include</b> directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the <b>#include</b> directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  char *test (void);
  </pre>
  <p>and a main program called <i>program.c</i> that uses the header file, like this &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  int x;
  #include "header.h"

  int main (void) {
     puts (test ());
  }
  </pre>
  <p>the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  int x;
  char *test (void);

  int main (void) {
     puts (test ());
  }
  </pre>
  <h2>Once-Only Headers</h2>
  <p>If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #ifndef HEADER_FILE
  #define HEADER_FILE

  the entire header file file

  #endif
  </pre>
  <p>This construct is commonly known as a wrapper <b>#ifndef</b>. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.</p>
  <h2>Computed Includes</h2>
  <p>Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #if SYSTEM_1
     # include "system_1.h"
  #elif SYSTEM_2
     # include "system_2.h"
  #elif SYSTEM_3
     ...
  #endif
  </pre>
  <p>But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a <b>computed include</b>. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of <b>#include</b>, you simply put a macro name there &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  #define SYSTEM_H "system_1.h"
  ...
  #include SYSTEM_H
  </pre>
  <p>SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the <b>#include</b> had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.</p>
  <h1>C - Type Casting</h1>
  <p>Type casting is a way to convert a variable from one data type to another data type. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the <b>cast operator</b> as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  (type_name) expression
  </pre>
  <p>Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/LlUZrX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  main() {

     int sum = 17, count = 5;
     double mean;

     mean = (double) sum / count;
     printf("Value of mean : %f\n", mean );
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Value of mean : 3.400000
  </pre>
  <p>It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of <b>sum</b> is first converted to type <b>double</b> and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.</p>
  <p>Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the <b>cast operator</b>. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.</p>
  <h2>Integer Promotion</h2>
  <p>Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than <b>int</b> or <b>unsigned int</b> are converted either to <b>int</b> or <b>unsigned int</b>. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/VkqrXY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  main() {

     int  i = 17;
     char c = 'c'; /* ascii value is 99 */
     int sum;

     sum = i + c;
     printf("Value of sum : %d\n", sum );
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Value of sum : 116
  </pre>
  <p>Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.</p>
  <h2>Usual Arithmetic Conversion</h2>
  <p>The <b>usual arithmetic conversions</b> are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs <i>integer promotion</i>; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy &minus;</p>
  <img src="/cprogramming/images/usual_arithmetic_conversion.png" alt="Usual Arithmetic Conversion" />
  <p>The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators &amp;&amp; and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/MImFCX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
  </div>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  main() {

     int  i = 17;
     char c = 'c'; /* ascii value is 99 */
     float sum;

     sum = i + c;
     printf("Value of sum : %f\n", sum );
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Value of sum : 116.000000
  </pre>
  <p>Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.</p>
  <h1>C - Error Handling</h1>
  <p>As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code <b>errno</b>. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in &lt;error.h&gt; header file.</p>
  <p>So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.</p>
  <h2>errno, perror(). and strerror()</h2>
  <p>The C programming language provides <b>perror()</b> and <b>strerror()</b> functions which can be used to display the text message associated with <b>errno</b>.</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>The <b>perror()</b> function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <b>strerror()</b> function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use <b>stderr</b> file stream to output all the errors.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;

  extern int errno ;

  int main () {

     FILE * pf;
     int errnum;
     pf = fopen ("unexist.txt", "rb");

     if (pf == NULL) {

        errnum = errno;
        fprintf(stderr, "Value of errno: %d\n", errno);
        perror("Error printed by perror");
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file: %s\n", strerror( errnum ));
     } else {

        fclose (pf);
     }

     return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Value of errno: 2
  Error printed by perror: No such file or directory
  Error opening file: No such file or directory
  </pre>
  <h2>Divide by Zero Errors</h2>
  <p>It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.</p>
  <p>The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing &minus;</p>

  <h2>Program Exit Status</h2>
  <p>It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.</p>
  <p>If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows &minus;</p>

  <h1>C - Recursion</h1>
  <p>Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  void recursion() {
     recursion(); /* function calls itself */
  }

  int main() {
     recursion();
  }
  </pre>
  <p>The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.</p>
  <p>Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.</p>
  <h2>Number Factorial</h2>
  <p>The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function &minus;</p>

     return i * factorial(i - 1);

  <h1>C - Variable Arguments</h1>
  <p>Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  int func(int, ... ) {
     .
     .
     .
  }

  int main() {
     func(1, 2, 3);
     func(1, 2, 3, 4);
  }
  </pre>
  <p>It should be noted that the function <b>func()</b> has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (<b>...</b>) and the one just before the ellipses is always an <b>int</b> which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of <b>stdarg.h</b> header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps &minus;</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><p>Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an <b>int</b> which will represent the number of arguments.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create a <b>va_list</b> type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use <b>int</b> parameter and <b>va_start</b> macro to initialize the <b>va_list</b> variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use <b>va_arg</b> macro and <b>va_list</b> variable to access each item in argument list.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use a macro <b>va_end</b> to clean up the memory assigned to <b>va_list</b> variable.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/lljlXP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

  double average(int num,...) {

     va_list valist;
     double sum = 0.0;
     int i;

     /* initialize valist for num number of arguments */
     va_start(valist, num);

     /* access all the arguments assigned to valist */
     for (i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) {
        sum += va_arg(valist, int);
     }

     /* clean memory reserved for valist */
     va_end(valist);

     return sum/num;
  }

  int main() {
     printf("Average of 2, 3, 4, 5 = %f\n", average(4, 2,3,4,5));
     printf("Average of 5, 10, 15 = %f\n", average(3, 5,10,15));
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function <b>average()</b> has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Average of 2, 3, 4, 5 = 3.500000
  Average of 5, 10, 15 = 10.000000

  <h1>C - Memory Management</h1>

  <h2>Allocating Memory Dynamically</h2>
  <p>While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  char name[100];
  </pre>
  <p>But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example &minus;</p>
  <div class="demo-view">
  <a href="http://tpcg.io/osfk0O" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;

  int main() {

     char name[100];
     char *description;

     strcpy(name, "Zara Ali");

     /* allocate memory dynamically */
     description = malloc( 200 * sizeof(char) );

     if( description == NULL ) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error - unable to allocate required memory\n");
     } else {
        strcpy( description, "Zara ali a DPS student in class 10th");
     }

     printf("Name = %s\n", name );
     printf("Description: %s\n", description );
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Name = Zara Ali
  Description: Zara ali a DPS student in class 10th
  </pre>
  <p>Same program can be written using <b>calloc();</b> only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  calloc(200, sizeof(char));
  </pre>
  <p>So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.</p>
  <h2>Resizing and Releasing Memory</h2>
  <p>When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function <b>free()</b>.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function <b>realloc()</b>. Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions &minus;</p>

     if( description == NULL ) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error - unable to allocate required memory\n");
     } else {
        strcat( description, "She is in class 10th");
     }

     printf("Name = %s\n", name );
     printf("Description: %s\n", description );

     /* release memory using free() function */
     free(description);
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  Name = Zara Ali
  Description: Zara ali a DPS student.She is in class 10th
  </pre>
  <p>You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.</p>
  <h1>C - Command Line Arguments</h1>
  <p>It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called <b>command line arguments</b> and many times they are important for your program especially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.</p>
  <p>The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where <b>argc</b> refers to the number of arguments passed, and <b>argv[]</b> is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly &minus;</p>

  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  $./a.out
  One argument expected
  </pre>
  <p>It should be noted that <b>argv[0]</b> holds the name of the program itself and <b>argv[1]</b> is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, and if you pass one argument then <b>argc</b> is set at 2.</p>
  <p>You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes &minus;</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int main( int argc, char *argv[] )  {

     printf("Program name %s\n", argv[0]);

     if( argc == 2 ) {
        printf("The argument supplied is %s\n", argv[1]);
     }
     else if( argc &gt; 2 ) {
        printf("Too many arguments supplied.\n");
     }
     else {
        printf("One argument expected.\n");
     }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.</p>
  <pre class="result notranslate">
  $./a.out "testing1 testing2"

  Progranm name ./a.out
  The argument supplied is testing1 testing2
